# Radiation Mapping Robot - Project Overview

This repository documents the development and deployment of a semi-autonomous robot for radiation mapping and environmental assessment in Marsabit County, Kenya. The project aims to address concerns about potential historical hazardous waste disposal in the region and contribute to a better understanding of the radiological conditions in the area.

## Project Goals

* Design and construct a robust, semi-autonomous robot capable of navigating challenging terrain and collecting accurate radiation data.
* Conduct a comprehensive radiation survey of a designated area in Marsabit.
* Generate a high-resolution radiation map, identifying potential hotspots and areas of concern.
* Collaborate with the Kenya Nuclear Regulatory Authority (KNRA) to analyze the data and inform potential mitigation strategies.
* Contribute to environmental protection and public health in the region.

## Robot Features

The robot will be equipped with the following key components:

* **6WD Off-road Chassis:** Provides stability and maneuverability on uneven terrain.
* **Arduino R4 WiFi:**  Serves as the robot's control center, handling sensor data, motor control, and wireless communication.
* **Geiger-MÃ¼ller Tube:** Detects ionizing radiation (gamma and beta) and provides real-time readings.
* **GPS Module:**  Accurately tracks the robot's location for precise data correlation.
* **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** Enhances navigation and orientation sensing.
* **FlySky FS-i6X Transmitter & FS-X6B Receiver:**  Enables reliable remote control and potential semi-autonomous operation.
* **LiPo Battery:** Provides ample power for extended operation.

## Design Considerations

* **Weight distribution and balance:**  Components will be strategically placed to maintain stability on uneven terrain.
* **Power management:**  Efficient power utilization will be prioritized to maximize battery life.
* **Component placement and mounting:**  Components will be arranged for accessibility, minimal interference, and secure mounting.
* **Enclosure (Optional):**  A protective enclosure might be used to shield the electronics from dust and moisture.

## Mapping Strategy

* **Phased Approach:** The survey area will be divided into smaller zones to ensure reliable radio control range and comprehensive coverage.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The operator will maintain optimal line of sight and relocate the base station as needed to maximize signal strength.
* **Autonomous Navigation (Potential):**  The robot's GPS and IMU will be utilized for potential semi-autonomous navigation capabilities.

## Data Analysis and Collaboration

* **Data Processing:**  Radiation data, GPS coordinates, and timestamps will be processed and visualized using appropriate software or programming libraries.
* **Radiation Map:** A high-resolution radiation map will be generated, correlating radiation readings with GPS coordinates.
* **Hotspot Identification:**  Algorithms will be used to identify areas with significantly elevated radiation levels.

This project offers a unique opportunity to apply robotics and nuclear physics expertise to address a real-world environmental challenge in Kenya. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the radiological conditions in Marsabit and support informed decision-making for environmental protection and public health.
