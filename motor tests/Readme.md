# 6WD Motor Test for Radiation Mapping Robot

This folder contains the code and documentation for the 6WD motor test conducted as part of my radiation mapping robot project.

## Objective

The objective of this test was to verify the functionality of the 6WD chassis, the motor drivers, and the FlySky FS-i6X transmitter and receiver for controlling the robot's movement.

## Hardware Setup

* **Chassis:** 6WD off-road chassis (from Pixel Electric) with 6 x 17000 rpm DC motors and 1:34 metal gearboxes.
* **Motor Drivers:** 3 x L298N dual H-bridge motor drivers.
* **Controller:** Arduino R3 (will be upgraded to Arduino R4 WiFi in the final robot).
* **Transmitter & Receiver:** FlySky FS-i6X transmitter and FS-X6B receiver.
* **Power Supply:** 11.1V 5000 mAH LiPo batter
